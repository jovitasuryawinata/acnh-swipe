An R Shiny app where you swipe left on the villagers you don't like and swipe right on those you do.

Built with [Nick Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me/)'s [{shinysense}](http://nickstrayer.me/shinysense/) package.

Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset/data) and [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/readme.md).

Very much a work in progress.
