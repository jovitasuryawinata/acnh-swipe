# shinysense 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* First release to CRAN!
* Updated package from previous versions to have more consistent naming schemes across functions.
* Ported `shinydrawr`, `shinylistenr`, `shinymovr`, and `shinyviewr` to `r2d3` for ease of maintenance and code readability.
